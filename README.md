# flutter_embedded

This repo is currently about build automation for Tip of the Tree Clang, Binutils, and Flutter Engine artifacts.  The useage target is for an embedded system.

# Motivation
See if Embedded Flutter is a compeling alternative to Chromium ContentShell+JS+CSS, and QT.

Areas of interest are memory footprint, stack latency, and where does it fit in the UI Framework landscape.

I can build a ContentShell browser that with the smallest of pages, only has a 15MB system heap footprint.  As the HTML5 application complexity increases, the memory usage ballons.  We're looking for controlled predictability.

In regards to latency, one test case will be CAN bus signal from an Automotive ODBC-II connector, rendering a gauge.


# Project Status

### I'm planning to refactor this repo to eliminate the Clang toolchain build, as Clang 8.0 is pulled in via the Engine build.  The only external deps in case of Linux building the Embedder Engine is fontconfig, and crtstartS/crtendS.  The actual runtime doesn't need Clang, and can be built with GCC.  For building the Engine with Yocto I have a solution that doesn't involve CMake; easier/cleaner/faster - [flutter_wayland](https://github.com/jwinarske/meta-flutter)


## * Raspberry PI bits *

The default build configuration (provided a properly configured sysroot), will generate bits that execute on a Raspberry Pi.

Planned Work Items
    
    1. Memory Profiling and optimization.  With Debug engine running a simple app on the PI, it's allocating around 150MB, with 12 threads.
    2. Platform Channel handler.  This will allow Dart to call C/C++ code.  Think CAN bus, I2C, SPI, RS-232, RS-485, MIDI, Audio, Espresso Machine I/O, etc.
    3. Support all 4 machine architectures to build on Linux.  Currently only ARM has been tested.
    4. Depending on demand and use cases, add support for building on Mac and Windows (although it may already work)...


# Pre-requisites

1. CMake 3.11 or greater

2. Setup depot_tools and add to path.  This provides gclient, ninja, autoninja, etc.

    http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chrome-infra-docs/flat/depot_tools/docs/html/depot_tools_tutorial.html#_setting_up

3. Confirm you can build the engine repo standalone

    https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Setting-up-the-Engine-development-environment

    https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Compiling-the-engine

    Install build dependencies with this shell script:

        install-build-deps.sh

4. Raspberry Pi prior to generating sysroot

        sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
        

# Build Tip-Of-Tree Clang, Latest Binutils, and Flutter Engine master branch for Linux arm

    git clone https://github.com/jwinarske/flutter_embedded
    cd flutter_embedded
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -GNinja
    autoninja

Note: Your build folder can be wherever you want...

# Override Variables
To use the override variables, pass them in with the cmake command.  One example

    cmake -DTOOLCHAIN_DIR=~/Android/Sdk/ndk-bundle/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64 -DTARGET_SYSROOT=~/Android/Sdk/ndk-bundle/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/sysroot -DTARGET_TRIPLE=arm-linux-androideabi-clang -DENGINE_REPO=https://github.com/jwinarske/engine -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

### TOOLCHAIN_DIR
This is the directory of the installed toolchain.  The default value used is "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/sdk/toolchain".  When the toolchain is built, it's installed to this directory.  If TOOLCHAIN_DIR is not set, it will build the toolchain.

### TARGET_SYSROOT
This is the location of the target sysroot.  The default value is "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/sdk/sysroot".  One approach would be to download target image such as a Raspberry Pi image, and mount it.  Setting TARGET_SYSROOT to the rootfs directory.

### TARGET_TRIPLE
This is the triple of your toolchain.  The default value used is "arm-linux-gnueabihf"

### TARGET_ARCH
This is the target architecture of your build.  It must  match your toolchain, and that which the flutter engine build supports.

### ENGINE_REPO
This is the repo of the flutter engine.  The default value is https://github.com/flutter/engine.git.  If you want to use your own fork, set this variable to point to your fork's url.

### LLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD
List of Targets LLVM should be built with.  Relavant to Flutter the options are:
"AArch64;ARM;X86".  Host architecture (x86_64) is implicit, as that is the expected build host.  If crosscompiling compiler-rt, libcxxabi, and libcxx the current scheme expects only a single value for LLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD.

### BUILD_COMPILER_RT
Checks out and builds compiler-rt for host and target.  Default value is ON, and valid only when TOOLCHAIN_DIR is not set.

### BUILD_LIBCXXABI
Checks out and builds libcxxabi for host and target.  Default value is ON, and valid only when TOOLCHAIN_DIR is not set.

### BUILD_LIBCXX
Checks out and builds libcxx.  Default value is ON, and valid only when TOOLCHAIN_DIR is not set.

### BUILD_LLD
Checks out and builds lld.  Default value is OFF, and valid only when TOOLCHAIN_DIR is not set.  This option enables the use of "-fuse-ld=lld".

### ENGINE_UNOPTIMIZED
Unoptimized flag, defaults to OFF

### ENGINE_RUNTIME_MODE
If ENGINE_RUNTIME_MODE is not set to debug, profile, or release, it will default to debug.

### ENGINE_DYNAMIC
Enable Dynamic, defaults to off.

### ENGINE_SIMULATOR
Enable simulator, defaults to OFF

### ENGINE_INTERPRETER
Enable interpreter, defaults to OFF

### ENGINE_DART_DEBUG
Enable dart-debug, defaults to OFF

### ENGINE_CLANG
Enable clang, defaults to ON

### ENGINE_GOMA
Enable goma, defaults to OFF

### ENGINE_LTO
Enable link-time optimization, defaults to ON

### ENGINE_EMBEDDER_FOR_TARGET
Embedder for Target, defaults to ON

### ENGINE_ENABLE_VULCAN
Enable Vulcan, defaults to OFF

# Android
Example building Android engine.  The flutter engine uses it's own NDK copy.  So passing in the toolchain file is for project builds (your own executables and libraries).

    cmake .. -GNinja -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=~/Android/Sdk/ndk-bundle/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake -DANDROID_ABI=armeabi-v7a -DANDROID_PLATFORM=17
    autoninja
    cmake .. -GNinja -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=~/Android/Sdk/ndk-bundle/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake -DENGINE_ENABLE_VULCAN=on -DANDROID_ABI=x86_64
    autoninja
    cmake .. -GNinja -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=~/Android/Sdk/ndk-bundle/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake -DENGINE_ENABLE_VULCAN=off -DANDROID_ABI=armeabi-v7a
    autoninja

# Raspberry Pi

To generate target binaries for a Raspberry Pi, you need a valid sysroot, prior to building

### sysroot - Default

    I dynamically create the target sysroot from this rootfs archive:
        https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/archive/2018-11-15-21:02/root.tar.xz

    The resultant build artifacts are compatible with any 2018-11-15 Raspbian image.  If you need a different rootfs version, you will need to update the wget command in flutter_embedded/cmake/rpi.sysroot.cmake.

### sysroot - Override / create from Raspbian img file

Download Raspbian Lite image from Raspbian Image Download Page

    https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite_latest


Extract the archive, which will give you a .img file. If on Ubuntu Bionic, double click the img file. It will auto-mount the partitions present. You're interested in the rootfs partition. From terminal or nautilus, copy the /lib, /opt, and /usr directories from the rootfs mount. Copy these to the default sysroot folder

    cd /media/$USER/rootfs
    cp -r lib {flutter_embedded git clone root}/sdk/sysroot
    cp -r opt {flutter_embedded git clone root}/sdk/sysroot
    cp -r usr {flutter_embedded git clone root}/sdk/sysroot

### sdk folder

The sdk folder will look like this after the toolchain has built properly

    ./sdk
    |-- sysroot
    |   |-- lib
    |   |-- opt
    |   `-- usr
    `-- toolchain
        |-- arm-linux-gnueabihf
        |-- bin
        |-- include
        |-- lib
        |-- libexec
        `-- share

### Flutter Engine Default Font for Linux

    Arial.ttf

Check your target using

    fc-match Arial

It should return    

    Arial.ttf: "Arial" "Normal"

If the Arial font is not present, you get this fatal error when attemping to launch Flutter

    LOG: /home/joel/git/flutter_embedded/build/rpi_flutter-prefix/src/rpi_flutter/flutter/main.cc:66: Display Size: 800 x 480
    flutter: Observatory listening on http://127.0.0.1:34949/
    [ERROR:flutter/third_party/txt/src/minikin/FontFamily.cpp(184)] Could not get cmap table size!

### Install Arial Font

    sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer
    sudo fc-cache

### Push Native Flutter build artifacts to Target

    scp -r {build folder}/target/* pi@raspberrypi.local:/home/pi

### Enable Linux as a Platform in your Flutter Repo

    cd <flutter git root (not this repo)>
    git apply <flutter_embedded repo>/cmake/flutter_platform.patch

Note that that Flutter repo does not have TargetPlatform.linux as part of Material design.  You have to add it by hand, or override debugDefaultTargetPlatformOverride and set it to a supported one...  There are a couple of cases that need a unique implementation for Linux.  Vibrate, etc.

Apply this changelist, if not present.  https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/24932/files

When adding in Linux support to the Dart code, start by adding "case TargetPlatform.linux:" to all switch cases found via

    cd {flutter repo}
    grep -r "case TargetPlatform.android:"

### Build your Flutter Application

    cd {flutter app project folder}
    flutter build bundle

*Note: You either need to override debugDefaultTargetPlatformOverride, or 
"Enable Linux as a Platform in your Flutter Repo"*

## Tested Flutter Examples

Tested apps post Flutter Dart "linux" platfrom add
    
    flutter/examples/catalog * Generates rendered text: "Instead run", "flutter run lib/xxx.dart"
    flutter/examples/flutter_gallery * key test case for platform
    flutter/examples/flutter_view
    flutter/examples/hello_world
    flutter/examples/layers * Generates rendered text: "Instead run", "flutter run lib/xxx.dart"
    flutter/examples/platform_channel *requires MessageCallback impl for 100%
    flutter/examples/platform_view * Android view not impl.. no-op btn
    flutter/examples/stocks
    flutter-desktop-embedding/example/flutter_app

Depending on the app, be preapred for Dart runtime exceptions.  Refer to https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues

### Push built Flutter Application to Target

    scp -r {flutter app root }/build/* pi@raspberrypi.local:/home/pi

### Execute Flutter on Target
Presuming you built your Flutter app, and pushed the build folder to your target, you can run it with this

    TSLIB_CONFFILE=/etc/ts.conf TSLIB_PLUGINDIR=/home/pi/lib/ts TSLIB_CALIBFILE=/etc/pointercal LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib ./bin/flutter ./build/flutter_assets/

*If your touch screen is not auto-detected correctly, specify the /dev/input/event[n] using the environmental variable TSLIB_TSDEVICE*

This can be run from a SSH session, or directly on the device.  You should see output like this, prior to the app being rendered

    LOG: /home/joel/git/flutter_embedded/build/rpi_flutter-prefix/src/rpi_flutter/flutter/main.cc:66: Display Size: 800 x 480
    flutter: Observatory listening on http://127.0.0.1:34949/

*Note: If you get unknown platform exception, you either need to override debugDefaultTargetPlatformOverride, or 
"Enable Linux as a Platform in your Flutter Repo"*

### Raspberry Pi 7" Touch Display

Verify your touch display is working correctly on your Raspberry Pi using evtest

    sudo apt-get install evtest

Running it, you should see something like

    $ evtest
    No device specified, trying to scan all of /dev/input/event*
    Not running as root, no devices may be available.
    Available devices:
    /dev/input/event0:	HID 0c45:7403
    /dev/input/event1:	HID 0c45:7403
    /dev/input/event2:	FT5406 memory based driver
    Select the device event number [0-2]:

The touch device in this case, is /dev/input/event2.  Selecting 2 will enable touch data to print to the console.

### Touch Panel Calibration

    sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib TSLIB_CONFFILE=/etc/ts.conf TSLIB_PLUGINDIR=/home/pi/lib/ts TSLIB_CALIBFILE=/etc/pointercal ./bin/ts_calibrate

## Touch Panel Applications

    sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib TSLIB_CONFFILE=/etc/ts.conf TSLIB_PLUGINDIR=/home/pi/lib/ts TSLIB_CALIBFILE=/etc/pointercal ./bin/ts_test
    sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib TSLIB_CONFFILE=/etc/ts.conf TSLIB_PLUGINDIR=/home/pi/lib/ts TSLIB_CALIBFILE=/etc/pointercal ./bin/ts_print

## Native Flutter Target Debug
I am successfully able to single step the Flutter Embedder using Host Side gdb-multiarch, and latest Eclipse release.  Target side requires gdbserver installed.  LLDB will be at a later date.

    sudo apt-get install gdbserver

Change build flags in this file

    {build folder}/engine-prefix/src/engine/src/build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn

To include

    if (is_linux) {
        if (current_cpu != "x86") {
            cflags_cc += [ 
            "-ggdb",

# Wayland

Building is currently supported using a Yocto project SDK

### Yocto SDK build

1. Follow steps in repo README to generate target image.  This repo is used for the DragonBoard 410c

    https://github.com/96boards/oe-rpb-manifest

2. Build SDK
        
        bitbake <image> -c populate_sdk

3. Install SDK.  Default install path is /usr/local/rpb-wayland-x86_64

    *Note: the required .o files are installed in the wrong place.  You have to copy or move them to the gcc folder.*

    Bug Filed: https://github.com/96boards/oe-rpb-manifest/issues/106

4. Build Flutter stack using SDK for DragonBoard 410c

        cd {flutter_embedded git clone root}
        mkdir build64 && cd build64
        cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel -DTARGET_ARCH=arm64 -DTARGET_SYSROOT=/usr/local/rpb-wayland-x86_64/sysroots/aarch64-linaro-linux -DTOOLCHAIN_DIR=/usr/local/rpb-wayland-x86_64/sysroots/x86_64-oesdk-linux/usr -DTARGET_TRIPLE=aarch64-linaro-linux -DBUILD_RPI_FLUTTER=OFF -DBUILD_WAYLAND_FLUTTER=ON -DENGINE_RUNTIME_MODE=release
